# 2.1.1 What's JS?

**ðŸ“– Article Resource:** [MDN Web Docs: JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

**JavaScript** is a high-level, interpreted (or just-in-time compiled), multi-paradigm programming language.

* **Interpreted/JIT Compiled:** JavaScript is compiled at runtime (Just-In-Time) by an engine (like Google's V8) just before execution, making development fast.
* **High-Level:** It abstracts complex details of the computer, allowing developers to focus on application logic.
* **Dynamically Typed:** Variable types are checked during runtime, not compile-time. You don't need to explicitly declare the type of data a variable will hold.
* **Multi-Paradigm:** It supports various programming styles, including:
    * **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** (using prototypes/classes).
    * **Imperative Programming** (step-by-step instructions).
    * **Functional Programming (FP)** (using functions as first-class citizens).
