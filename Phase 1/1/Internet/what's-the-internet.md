The Internet is a **global network of interconnected computer networks** that communicate using a common set of rules known as the **Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)**.

It is a massive, decentralized system designed for the efficient, reliable, and standardized exchange of data between any two points on the globe.

## Core Components and Roles

The Internet functions through the collaboration of various hardware and software roles:

| Component | Role in the Network | Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Client** | A device (like your phone or laptop) or a program (like your web browser) that **requests** data or services. | A person asking for a book at a library. |
| **Server** | A computer program or device that **provides** resources (like web pages, files, or data) upon request. | The librarian or the library itself, holding and delivering the book. |
| **Router** | A specialized network device that **directs data packets** between computer networks, choosing the most efficient path. | A traffic cop or postal sorting office determining the next stop. |
| **Data Packet** | A small unit of data into which all information (like a photo or an email) is broken down before transmission. It includes the source and destination addresses. | An individual letter or parcel with an address label. |

## Essential Protocols (The TCP/IP Suite)

The Internet relies on the **TCP/IP** (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) suite:

* **IP (Internet Protocol):** Responsible for **addressing and routing**. It uses unique **IP Addresses** to ensure data packets reach the correct destination.
* **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Ensures **reliable delivery**. It establishes a connection, orders the packets, re-sends any that are lost, and reassembles the data stream correctly.
