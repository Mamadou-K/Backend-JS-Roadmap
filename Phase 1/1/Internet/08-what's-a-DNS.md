# 1.3.2 What's a DNS?

**DNS** stands for **Domain Name System**.

* **Analogy:** It is often called the **"phonebook"** of the Internet.
* **Core Function:** It translates the human-friendly **Domain Names** (e.g., `example.com`) into their corresponding machine-readable **IP Addresses** (e.g., `192.0.2.1`).
* **Necessity:** Computers need IP addresses to locate and communicate with servers; DNS provides this translation service so users don't have to memorize IP addresses.
