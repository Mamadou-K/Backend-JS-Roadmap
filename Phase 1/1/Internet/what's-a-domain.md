A **Domain Name** is a human-readable and easy-to-remember address used to access websites (e.g., `google.com`).

* **Purpose:** It serves as an alias for a numerical **IP Address**, which is the actual location of the server hosting the website.
* **Structure:** A domain name is hierarchical, separated by dots:
    * **Top-Level Domain (TLD):** The last part (`.com`, `.org`, `.net`, `.io`).
    * **Second-Level Domain (SLD):** The name chosen by the organization (`google`, `microsoft`, `yourcompany`).
    * **Subdomain:** The optional part before the SLD (`www`, `mail`, `api`).
